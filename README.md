### About

Inner Compass is an **App Playground** created with the intention of giving a meaningful experience to those who struggle with identifying their emotions.
The interactive scene guides the user through a session of self reflection during which they are invited to give themselves some time to think about their feelings without judgment, and to put them into words. A set of emotions to choose from is provided and a spinning wheel of broad emotional states constitutes the main navigation tool, metaphorically representing a digital and real life Inner Compass.
